## About

This course is for experienced developers that want to get better at designing well-crafted solutions. It focuses on designing software that is responsive to changing requirements and new functionality, avoiding the pitfalls that lead to legacy code.

## Why attend?

* Learn design techniques applied in successful projects
* Use TDD as a design tool, applying Outside-In TDD
* Drive out a flexible design
* Build software that is not bound to a specific technology or framework by keeping them at the boundaries of your system
* Express your business domain in every facet of your entire application, not just methods and classes
* Keep your design clean as your application grows and requirements change
* Let your architecture emerge, rather than designing a rigid and unchangeable structure up-front

## Content

* Four elements of simple design
* Use TDD as a design tool with Outside-In TDD
* Business application of SOLID principles
* Testing and refactoring legacy code to express business domain
* Interaction Driven Design (IDD)
	* Map and visualise business concepts in code
	* Express design and architecture in code, but keeping your domain clear
	* Learn an evolution of a subset of DDD

* Have experience in developing software commercially
* Are familiar with at least one Object Oriented Language (such as Java and C#)
* Are able to understand Java (the codebase and exercises are in Java)
* Are comfortable using TDD to build software
* Understand mock objects and know how to use a mocking library

## Prerequisites
