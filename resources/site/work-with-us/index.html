    <h1>Software Craftsman</h1>

    <h3>What type of developers are you looking for?</h3>

    <p>You consider yourself a software <strong>crafter</strong>. You care about and
    are <strong>proud</strong> of the code you write. You care about doing meaningful
    work and providing value to your clients or employer via well-crafted code. For
    you, writing code is not just a job but also a passion.</p>

    <p><strong>T</strong>est-<strong>D</strong>riven <strong>D</strong>evelopment is
    second nature to you and that's how you write code. You don't use "lack of time" as
    an excuse to do a mediocre job, and fully understand the long-term costs and
    benefits of hacking a project together. You prefer to work in small increments,
    trying things out and iterating rapidly, tightening the feedback loop as much as
    possible.</p>

    <p>You are a <strong>team player</strong>. You understand that software lives on
    long after it is first delivered, and that many different people will contribute to
    it over its lifetime. You enjoy working with other people, including other coders
    but also designers, business analysts, testers and anyone else working on the same
    project. You enjoy frequent collaboration, including pair-programming.</p>

    <p>As a <strong>passionate</strong> developer, you spend a considerable amount of
    time outside working hours investing in your craft, learning new technologies and
    practicing different techniques and approaches. You create for creation's sake,
    building pet projects or contributing to open-source development. You don't do this
    because a client or employer asks you to; you do it because you want to.</p>

    <p>As part of the learning process, you consider it important to
    <strong>share</strong> what you know with others. This might take the form of a
    blog, some code on GitHub, attendance at community events or something totally
    different. You also consider it your responsibility to help your fellow colleagues;
    perhaps this manifests itself as formal knowledge-sharing sessions in the
    workplace, but just as likely, it's simply coaching as and when it's necessary.</p>

    <p>You understand that languages and frameworks are just tools. You choose the best
    tools for the job <strong>without being religious</strong> about it. The majority
    of books and articles you read are the ones that makes you a better developer and
    not a specialist in a specific framework. At the same time, you are extremely
    proficient with at least one or two programming languages and the tools around
    them, including testing frameworks, wiring and dependency injection mechanisms,
    user interface libraries and development environments.</p>

    <p>You understand and embrace <strong>Agile</strong> processes, and are able to
    help other people to understand and adopt them. You are able to work closely with
    clients and product owners and help them to refine requirements and plan the work
    to be done.</p>

    <p>You are proud to be a developer and want to remain a developer. You believe in
    emergent and collaborative architecture and design; you use your knowledge of
    <strong>SOLID</strong> principles, the Four Elements of Simple Design, and
    <strong>D</strong>omain-<strong>D</strong>riven <strong>D</strong>esign to design
    applications that reflect the business domain.</p>

    <p>If you believe you can meet the bar set, we are <strong>definitely interested in
    hearing from you</strong>.</p>

    <h3>What technologies do you use?</h3>

    <p>We use whatever is fit for purpose. We love trying new things and experimenting,
    and you'll be hard-pressed to find an occasion where none of us are learning a new
    technology, paradigm, skill or technique. We value the ability to learn new things
    over specific existing knowledge. Our industry is incredibly fast-paced, and
    there's always something new over the horizon.</p>

    <p>Right now, the majority of our clients use <strong>Java</strong>,
    <strong>Scala</strong>, and <strong>C#</strong> and those are the core skills we
    are looking for. Knowledge of any other language and tools in the
    <strong>JVM</strong> and <strong>.NET</strong> ecosystems (like
    <strong>Clojure</strong> and <strong>F#</strong>) is highly desirable but not
    essential. Everything else really does differ from client to client, and you will
    learn them on the job.</p>

    <h3>What is expected from a craftsman at Codurance?</h3>

    <p>As a craftsman at Codurance, you are expected to be able to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>build well-crafted bespoke applications for our clients,</li>

      <li>lead by example: you strive to work at your best, you don't cut corners, and
      you always behave with professionalism, regardless of which environment you are
      in,</li>

      <li>work with fellow craftsmen and our clients, helping them to get better at
      delivering quality software,</li>

      <li>mentor apprentices: helping those with less experience along their own
      journey in becoming a craftsman,</li>

      <li>become proficient in multiple languages and technologies,</li>

      <li>give something back to the community, writing articles, sharing code, giving
      talks, running workshops, and participating in external technical communities,
      especially the <a href="http://londonswcraft.com">London Software Craftsmanship
      Community (LSCC)</a>, and</li>

      <li>be humble, always respecting, sharing knowledge with, and learning from
      developers and others in the software industry, regardless of their skill and
      experience, whether they are part of Codurance or not.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What are the advantages of being a craftsman at Codurance?</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Exposure to many different projects, clients, industries, and
      technologies.</li>

      <li>Being part of an amazing team of craftsmen, which guarantees that you will
      always be learning.</li>

      <li>Working for a company with a flat structure, with no managers, no architects,
      and no team leaders. Just awesome developers.</li>

      <li>Recognition and respect for being a great developer.</li>

      <li>5 days of conference allowance per year.</li>

      <li>Get to know awesome craftsmen from all over Europe.</li>

      <li>Encouragement to speak at conferences.</li>

      <li>You will have autonomy and <a href=
      "http://codurance.com/2016/02/22/open-financials/">full access to the company's
      financials</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Do I need to be based in London?</h3>

    <p>Yes. Or at least at a commutable distance from London. Although we give
    consultancy and trainings all over Europe, most of our projects are based in or
    around London. Most of our clients expect us to be in their offices frequently and
    we also expect our craftsmen and apprentices to meet very regularly and in person
    in our office.</p>

    <p>If you don't live in the UK, we can help you with some of the moving costs as
    long as you have the rights to work in the UK.</p>

    <h3>I want to apply. What do I need to do?</h3>

    <p>If you think Codurance is for you, drop us a line at <strong><a href=
    "mailto:hello@codurance.com">hello@codurance.com</a></strong> and tell us your

    </ul>

    <p>We also want links. If you're up for sharing any of the following, send them
    along. If you don't have them, that's not a problem; we value people, not text.</p>

      <li>any open-source projects you've worked on</li>
